My version of a 100% save file for Into The ERadius 1. Everything scavenged from the zone.


Every gun fully upgraded and loaded along with mags and ammo hung on the wall, as well as an un-upgraded version in red repair status.

Extra scopes/suppressors/mags/ammo/cleaning stuff/food/nades/knives/smokes/health/cake.

Every Artifact, "Strange" item, and sellable loot (camera, voice recorder, weather monitor, sparklers, sample containers).
Mission items like Criers and Black Boxes despawn, as well as shards. I'll have to mod those in.

Most tapes and notes, though I haven't catalogued them.

Most artifact spawns mapped.

Quite a bit of $.

Better lighting.
The cake in Vanno is for better lighting. Unfortunately the candles all go out when you leave or load a save.
The other light lighting the red container is on the concrete beam above the yellow container.

A few other things.

Installation
This is for Steam V2.x, does not work with quest AFAIK.
 
Go to
C:\Users\[username]\Documents\My Games\IntoTheRadius\v2.0\saves
BACK UP YOUR SAVES!BACK UP YOUR SAVES!BACK UP YOUR SAVES!
You should already be backing up game saves, if you aren't, now is a good time to do so.

Rename
The downloaded save file (IntoTheRadius.1.1.save) to use the save slot you want.
The first number in the filename is the profile, the second number is the
save slot in that profile, if you want to use profile #4 save slot #3,
you would rename to IntoTheRadius.4.3.save

Drag and drop
Your renamed save file into C:\Users\[username]\Documents\My Games\IntoTheRadius\v2.0\saves
If you have an existing save in the slot you want to use this will overwrite it.

Done

Uninstallation
Restore your backup.

Hoping I can make something like this for ITR2, but I hate new vanno so far.
